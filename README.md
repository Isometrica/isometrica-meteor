## VISION

People all over the world use ISO management systems to improve control over business processes, across a wide range of sectors and sizes of organizations.
More than 1.5 million ISO certificates have been issued, according to the latest ISO survey (http://www.iso.org/iso/iso-survey).

There’s a lack of quick-to-set-up and easy-to-use software for running ISO management systems. Very few of the existing systems are built around a modern cloud architecture. Very few are built to be used on mobile devices as well as PCs. Our vision for Isometrica is to fill this gap, to create a system which meets 3 key objectives:

1 Modular and integrated
- based around the new Annex SL format, and can be used to run multiple ISO management systems in an integrated fashion.

2 Flexible and easy deployment 
-  some users value convenience and easy of setup, others need more control over their data, so a modern system needs to be deployable either as software-as-a-service or on-premise.  For software-as-a-service deployment, users should be able to set up a new account in just a couple of minutes.

3 Ease of use
- let’s transform the job of running an ISO management system from a chore into a pleasure, and create a system that can be used equally easily on PCs or mobile devices

## ROADMAP

We intend to deliver the first module - quality management - in late 2015, supporting the new ISO 9001:2015 standard.

We will then follow on with one new module every few months, prioritising three ISO management systems which already support the new Annex SL format:
- ISO 14001:2015 for Environmental Management
- ISO 22301:2012 for Business Continuity Management
- ISO 27001:2013 for Information Security Management
